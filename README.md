# Knowledge-Check-Bootstrap-Basics
This is an assignment for Coding Temple.
In this assignment I made a Form for people to leave their information nad bellow a table to display the data that the form collacts(not really).
I also made a some  cool images and buttons that can be pressed as well as the hidden button. 
Finally I made a navbar that compressing into a hamburger menu on small screens.
Oh and theres also a footer just to complete the page.
